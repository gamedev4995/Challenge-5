# Challenge 5 - Go Ahead and Jump
For this challenge, we implemented action functions for our robot to move based on a player's input!

### Player Input Guide

| Fast Vertical movement   | Left and Right Shift                   |

We first need to install the input system into our unity to get the player's inputs.

Go to menu at the top and click Window > Package Manager > Unity Registry > Search for Input System > Install. Once this is installed, we can now begin with oour project!

## Rigid Body

We first start off by adding a Rigidbody component to our character. The Rigidbody will allow physic properties to our character like gravity, collisions, and other physical interactions.

## Capsule Collider

Next, we add a capsule collider to grasp the shape of our character. We adjusted the y-coordinate based on our character height and radius based on width.

## Player Input 

Afterwards, to take in our player's input, we added the component 'Player Input'. We then hit Create Action > named it 'Movement' > Save.

## Terrain

We also added a Terrain for our character to roam freely and have somewhere to land when jumping.

## Script

For our player movement, we first added a new script where we would write the code. Clicking on the character, to the left where the 'Inspector' window appears, scroll all the way down and click Add Component > New Script, we named it 'PlayerMove'. Afterwards, we opened the new script and began coding our actions.

___Note___: sure to add the library InputSystem for your player's input!

  ### > Horizontal & Vertical Movement 

In the player input actions, we made sure to have our select keys (WASD or arrows) for each movement properly adjusted.

For our player's movement around the map, we created two variables: speed and movement value.

We then added our function OnMove to detect the player's movement if they're pressing any of the selected keys to move horizontally or vertically.

  ### > Shoot
  
Before diving into the code for shooting, it's important to do the following steps beforehand:
1. Create a bullet prefab

For the bullet, we first created a sphere (GameObject > 3D Object > Sphere) and scaled it down to a small size.

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 134242" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acaf376c-14b3-4ffa-83da-45480abd67a4">

Then we created a new material by right clicking > Create > Material in the assets area or by clicking the ‘+’ symbol > Material.

<img width="385" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 133959" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f89feb3-595c-4d58-b969-8d4ed8ec6944">

In the inspector tab of the material, within Surface Inputs, we changed the Base Map to our choice of color and added an emission for a glowing effect. 

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 134147" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f2be6b3f-7f4f-41d3-a2ce-977a74201218">

Then we dragged the material onto the sphere previously created. 

<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 134252" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31d19f82-db86-46df-97ff-50adc5713589">

With the bullet’s look completed, we turned it into a prefab by dragging the object from the Hierarchy tab onto a prefab folder.

2. Create a new script

Within the prefab of the bullet, in the inspector tab, we created a new script (Add Component > New script) which we named “forwardMovement”. 
For this script, we added the public variable 'speed' and the following code for the purpose of providing movement for when the bullets are shot out.

<img width="500" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 160802" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0f3c9e-8f1a-4f60-95b8-3f25db26401b">

Lastly, in Unity, be sure to change the value of the speed.

<img width="350" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 161136" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb0a6659-a6c3-46ef-9e1e-607e77ed9873">

3. Create empty object

For the character to shoot the bullets, we first had to create an empty object (GameObject > empty) which we referred to as ShootPoint, positioned it where we would want the bullets to come out of and then moved the object onto the hierarchy of the asset.

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 140608" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f022df58-7cca-44ba-ac3b-b7dc88f62510">

Back in with the movement script:

We added the following variables:

<img width="286" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 170922" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7e90ed0-e2ed-4cc6-8f48-e34ed01035c8">

Continuing, we added the following OnFire function, based on the Fire action already established by Unity, that creates an instance/copy of the bullet prefab and positions it where the shooting point object is located once the left mouse button is pressed.

<img width="700" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 213631" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/278a7512-6149-45f2-ae55-c195d39de72b">

Lastly, in Unity, drag the bullet prefab and the shootPoint empty onto their respective variables.

<img width="350" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-04 161206" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09a3b2d7-8a1d-45f6-ba20-fd0acf25a3e8">

  ### > Jump 
  
In the player input actions, we added a new action by pressing on the '+' next to "Actions" to which we named "Jump".

<img width="400" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 214242" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d55efc5-1711-4b21-8f84-b02d36c7a692">

Then, in the binding properties, next to "Path" we assigned the spacebar of the keyboard. This can be done by typing "spacebar" in the search bar or by pressing "listen" button and tapping the spacebar.

<img width="550" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 214500" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/516e10de-fb6d-4917-b6b0-9f3d285c7dd8">

Back in our PlayerMove script, we added the following variable:

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 220509" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9978e12f-f7a7-469f-b31b-762737fecdb4">

_Note:_ Value can be changed for preference

Lastly, we added the following OnJump function, based on the Jump action we added, to allow the player to jump:

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 221303" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f0b8f94-8c33-4c0d-81e7-46efc73835f4">

  ### > Look
For the player to look around, we started off by adding the following variables:

<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 220221" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/652ef5ad-d44e-4241-a473-13aae004e5eb">

Then, we added the following OnLook function, based on the Look action already established by Unity:

<img width="550" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 221608" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f5203a6-2ef0-4cc5-acf9-601d391218d7">

Lastly, with the lookValue, we can apply the rotation in the Update() with the following code:

<img width="650" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-12 221826" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f49f9ebc-0049-49ee-9d66-1d0495fb859b">

  ### > Fast Horizontal & Vertical Movement
  To make our character move fast, as in sprint, first we have to create a new public variable called sprintSpeed, which we can set to 0, and a private bool isSprinting, which needs to be initialized to false.
  
<img width="600" alt="Screenshot 2024-10-13 at 8 28 13 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d2b84a7-ec97-476d-9fe8-6ebbed6b1186">

  
  Next we need to adjust the OnMove function. Inside the function add an if/else statement that checks the boolean isSprinting. If true the movementValue will be multiplied by the sprintSpeed. Otherwise the movementValue is multiplied by the regular player speed. Finally set isSprinting to false again.
